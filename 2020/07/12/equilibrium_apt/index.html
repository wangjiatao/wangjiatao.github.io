        <h1 id="equilibrium-amp-the-apt-theory"><a href="#equilibrium-amp-the-apt-theory" class="headerlink" title="equilibrium &amp; the apt theory"></a>equilibrium &amp; the apt theory</h1><p>The market equilibrium could be defined as a state that all components of a system keep stable or balance. That means any power or information could not be escaped from this system. Any atoms and their interaction are restricted in the inside of system.    </p>
<p>If we could find a matrix, like a Markov matrix, to describe the relationship between different individuals of the system from t-1 to t, we can create a dynamic process model to define the system. If we could prove or infer the matrix that could reach in a stable state with market and asset-self evolving, the equilibrium conditions were expressed in another form at that time.<br>The apt model describes a linear relationship between asset return and multiple risk factors. The coefficients of apt will change with market price; then, we could collect historical data to plotting a dynamic process of asset return under apt framework. Based on above thought, the only mission is to prove whether the coefficient will converge.       </p>
<p>Ax=y is a core function of apt theory. An one dimension vector can extend to a matrix given a time window t. The t is a variable, while we should analyze sensitivity between t and apt matrix to find an optimal t value. Considering the matrix property of matrix, it may be an optimal choice to analyze a dynamic process or multiple variables model.       </p>
<p>According to observe time-varying process of historical data, we can find each point of Markov matrix is a variable, the random matrix. Therefore, we can use entropy to measure whether the system is convergence . When the variance of each point in Markov matrix reaches local or global minimum point, which depends on our research requirements, that means the system trend to be stable if it can reach a stable level.     </p>
<p>The other idea is that whether it is necessary to prove asymptotic convergence, and how much useful the asymptotic property is.     </p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the matrix is a perfect tool to describe a dynamic system, while it has some excellent properties to optimize calculation, such as eigenvalue and SVD decomposition.        </p>
<p>linear function and information loss.<br><a href="/linearregressioninformationloss.md">linear regression and information loss</a> </p>
<p>Given a model is orthogonality, a linear function model describes a dynamic change process with coordinate from the driven factors aspect. However, if the object’s dynamic process was non-linear, that means the linear function model’s coefficients would be time-varying, while we just need focus on time series data. If the time-varying coefficients matrix, which represents the system’s state, can not converge with time, we can not detect when an equilibrium state will appear, while the linear function model is used for analyzing non-linear data.      </p>
<p>The multi-variables linear system of equations and the matrix of its coefficients have some flaws because linear function will lose some information when we use it for describing a dynamic process. The stochastic matrix describes an object’s process from t-1 to t, but not factors that drive the object. If y were driven by some factors, the stochastic matrix or transfer matrix would has an inner relationship between its coefficients of multiple dimension function group, which is not just a statical coefficients system, but a time-varying process.       </p>
<p>There are two methods to describe a system’s state, including transfer matrix and partial differential equation. The former is based on probability theory and latter describes a system’s instantaneous changes. PDE is a micro-scale tool relative to the transfer matrix because we can not see the total trajectory of changes by it.       </p>
<p>There are three indicators until now that include transfer matrix, coefficients matrix, and PDE. The transfer matrix is used for describing the object Y from t-1 to t. It is an one-dimensional system with a time dimension, or the time series. The coefficients matrix have two dimension, time and driven factors list.       </p>
<p>Given a determinate time t, a coefficients matrix elaborates on a relationship between input factors and output factors. At the same time, the coefficients matrix also depicts the trajectory of sensitive changes between input and output with time dimension. The PDE represents a instantaneous shock of output system. The PDE and transfer matrix are based on two different observation aspects. Notably, there would be an information loss or unreliable when we infer from PDE to a complete system by an integral equation because of its endogenous instability.       </p>
<p>The Euclid geometry and non-Euclid geometry<br>Space coordinate relationship of different objects is quantitative analysis’s core point. The accuracy of measuring this variable determines how accurately we can describe it.<br>It is explicit that space relationships and mapping are core conception in quantitative analysis.     </p>
